# Hello-World
Hello world assignment for C/C++ class due Friday 14, 2022
My name is Clifford Washington and I am 19 years old. 
I am also from New Orleans LA.
I hope I am doing this assignment right, even though you didn't ask for all this information.
Looking forward to learning a lot from you this semester!
